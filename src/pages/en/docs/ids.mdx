In Rhodonite, most objects are assigned IDs so that they can be identified and managed by IDs.

## Types of IDs
("XXX" in the following explanation means the same element)

### TypeID (XXX_TID)
  - An ID that represents a kind about XXX; the number space is closed within XXX and also unique within it.
  - A practical example is `ComponentTID`.
### UniqueID (XXX_UID)
  - An ID to identify an entity (multiple generable instances, alive or dead) of "XXX".
  - Once an entity is created, all entities are assigned a UniqueID, and the assignment is never changed regardless of whether the entity is alive or dead.
  - Examples include `EntityUID` and `ObjectUID`.
### ScopedID (XXX_SID)
  - Basically a unique ID, but the number space is closed within the corresponding TypedID and a unique identification number within it. This means that numbers may overlap between different TypedID ranges.
  - A practical example is the `ComponentSID`.

### other rules

- Even if the same "XXX" is used, UniqueID, ScopedID, and TypeID have a different number space from each other.
- For all types of IDs, the numbering starts from zero. Negative values (especially -1 for operational use) are interpreted as "invalid or not specified.

## Representative IDs

### EntityUID

UniqueID assigned to an instance of Entity. It is often used to retrieve or specify a specific Entity.

````javascript
const entityRepository = Rn.EntityRepository.getInstance();
const meshEntity = entityRepository.createEntity([Rn.TransformComponent, Rn.SceneGraphComponent]);
console.log(meshEntity.entityUID)
````

### ObjectUID

UniqueID assigned to an instance of a class that extends RnObject; since Entity is also a RnObject, Entity has both an entityUID and an objectUID.

```javascript
const rnObject = new RnObject();
console.log(rnObject.objectUID);

const entityRepository = Rn.EntityRepository.getInstance();
const entity = entityRepository.createEntity([]);
console.log(entity.objectUID);
```

### ComponentTID

TypeID representing the type of component. It is also a static ID whose value is fixed at the time of compilation.
A typical ComponentTID is [this file in Rhodonite](https://github.com/emadurandal/RhodoniteTS/blob/master/src/foundation/components/ WellKnownComponentTIDs.ts).

### ComponentSID

ScopedID of the component instance.

```javascript
const entityRepository = Rn.EntityRepository.getInstance();
const meshEntity = entityRepository.createEntity([Rn.TransformComponent, Rn.SceneGraphComponent]);
const transformComponent = meshEntity.getTransforom();
console.log(transformComponent.componentSID);
```
