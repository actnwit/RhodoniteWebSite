Initialization of Rhodonite is simple.

In the Rn.System.init method, specify the process approach and the Canvas to draw to. Don't forget to specify `await`.

Depending on which process approach is chosen, the internal processing of WebGL differs.
For the latest Rhodonite we recommend DataTexture.

```javascript
await Rn.System.init({
  approach: Rn.ProcessApproach.DataTexture,
  canvas: document.getElementById('world')
};
```

### List of Process Approaches

| Type | Characteristics |
|:-----------|------------|
| Uniform | Works with WebGL2. Uses Uniform variables for passing shader parameters, suitable for troubleshooting as you can check the parameters passed to Uniform variables in e.g. specter.js. |
| DataTexture | Works with WebGL2. Uses floating point textures for passing shader parameters. Normally recommended to use this instead of Uniform. |
| WebGPU | Works with WebGPU |

## Summary

The following is a summary of the code up to this point.

```typescript
// Set up System (specify process approach and pass in canvas)
await Rn.System.init({
  approach: Rn.ProcessApproach.DataTexture,
  canvas: document.getElementById('world')
});
```

Rhodonite initialization is now complete.
Now it is time to create 3D data by writing the necessary data in code or reading it from a file such as glTF, and pass it to the System's process method via an Expression instance for rendering. The specific method is explained on the next page.
