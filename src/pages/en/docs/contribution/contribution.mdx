There are many ways to contribute to Rhodonite.
Some of them do not require much knowledge of computer graphics or programming.

### Bug Reporting

This is the easiest way to contribute.
The version of Rhodonite you are using is output to the developer console of your browser, so please report the bug on the Github issue with the version string and the situation when the bug occurred.
Please use English (if you are not good at writing in English, please use Google Translate or DeepL).

### Discussion

Discussions at [Discussions](https://github.com/actnwit/RhodoniteTS/discussions) in the Github repository are also appreciated, as their contents are also useful for others to learn and refer to.
There is also a [Japanese section](https://github.com/actnwit/RhodoniteTS/discussions/930), so if you are Japanese and not comfortable communicating in English via Issue or pull requests, please use the Discussions section.

### Participation in development (pull requests)

For small code improvements, etc., please create a pull request on Github.
You may create a pull request directly for an issue without prior notification.
(If you are not good at writing in English, please use Google Translate or DeepL.)

### Development Participation (Full Participation)

If you would like to participate more actively in the development, please contact the main developer, emadurandal.

### Feature Requests

Please post your feature request in an Issue on Github.
Please note that we may not always be able to fulfill your request, as it is a comprehensive decision whether or not to respond to your request.

### Articles about use cases and usage

The Rhodonite development team would be very pleased to have you write an article about your case study or how you use Rhodonite.
Rhodonite is not yet released in a stable version, so specifications may change from time to time.
When you write an article, please specify in the text the version of Rhodonite you are using.
