Rhodonite uses the component system, which is also found in Unity and Unreal Engine.
By loading one or more components onto an Entity, meaning an object in 3D space, the Entity acquires the functionality of the loaded component.

## About Entity

Entity is the equivalent of an object in 3D space; an Entity itself is nothing more than a container with its own ID.
By adding components with various functions to the Entity, the Entity can perform those functions in the 3D space.

To create an Entity, do the following

```ts
const entity = Rn.EntityRepository.createEntity();
```

To add a component to an Entity, do the following.

```ts
const entityAddedComponent = Rn.EntityRepository.addComponentToEntity(
  TransformComponent,
  entity
);
```

In practice, we would use the `createXXXEntity` methods that return a Component-loaded Entity.

```ts
const groupEntity = Rn.EntityHelper.createGroupEntity(); // with TransformComponent, SceneGraphComponent
const meshEntity = Rn.EntityHelper.createMeshEntity(); // with TransformComponent, SceneGraphComponent, MeshComponent, MeshRendererComponent
```

## Typical components

Here are some typical components.

### Transform component

This component internally generates a transformation matrix that indicates the object's orientation based on the translate, rotate, and scale settings.

```typescript
const cubeTransformComponent = cubeEntity.getTransform();
cubeTransformComponent.translate = Rn.Vector3.fromCopy3(0, 3, 0);
cubeTransformComponent.rotate = Rn.Vector3.fromCopy3(90, 0, 0);
cubeTransformComponent.scale = Rn.Vector3.fromCopy3(2, 2, 2);
```

### SceneGraph component

This component forms the parent-child relationship (scene graph) of an object and generates a world matrix by integrating the transformation matrix of the Transform component. This component is also required for Entity that places objects in 3D space.

```typescript
const groupEntity = Rn.EntityHelper.createSceneGraphEntity();
const cubeEntity = Rn.MeshHelper.createCube();
const groupSceneGraphComponent = groupEntity.getSceneGraph();
groupSceneGraphComponent.addChild(cubeEntity.getSceneGraph());
```

### Mesh component

This component holds polygon mesh data.

### MeshRenderer component

This component receives mesh data from the Mesh component and draws the mesh using a 3D API such as WebGL.

### Skeletal component

This component performs the skinning process.

### Camera component

This component is responsible for camera functions.

### Light component

This component is responsible for light functions. Currently supports point light, directional light, and spot light.

### Effekseer component

Components for playing back effects from the open-source effects tool `Effekseer`.

### Component Processing Flow

#### Starting point for processing

Rhodonite first creates a System instance, then builds an Expression, and finally starts the process by specifying an array of Expressions in the system.process method.

```javascript
// Initializes Rhodonite
const gl = system.init({
  approach: Rn.ProcessApproach.UniformWebGL2,
  canvas: document.getElementById('world')
});

// constructs expressions
...

// drawing
const draw = function (time) {

  Rn.System.process([expression]);

  requestAnimationFrame(draw);
};

draw();
````

So basically, the system.process method, which is called once for each drawing frame, is the starting point for processing.

#### Data Hierarchy

##### Frame, Expression, RenderPass
A frame holds drawing information for a single frame, specifically, an array of expressions. An Expression holds multiple RenderPasses as an array. Each RenderPass can specify a group of entities to be processed. And each Entity has multiple Components.
The image is as follows

- Frame
  - Array of Expressions
    - Expression 1
    - Expression 2
      - Array of render paths
        - Render Path 1
        - Render path 2
          - Entity1
          - Entity2
          - Entity3
            - TransformComponent
            - SceneGraphComponent
            - MeshComponent
            - ...
          - ...
        - ...
    - ...

In addition, components have the concept of "stages of processing". These are the following stages

- ProcessStage.Create
- ProcessStage.Load
- Logic
- PreRender
- Render

Basically, in each component, the stage of processing transitions from top to bottom.
No component belongs to more than one stage at a time, and each component always processes only one stage at a time.
Each Component has a method with a name that corresponds to each stage.
For example, the method of the Component corresponding to `ProcessStage.Create` is the `$Create` method.
In the Create stage, the $Create method would be executed.


### Actual Processing Process

Although the data hierarchy has been explained, the actual order of execution is not simply from top to bottom of this data hierarchy.
Let's look at the actual contents of the System.process method. The loop structure is as follows.

````typescript
  process(expressions: Expression[]) {

    // First, execute the loop in the order of the "stage of processing" type
    for (let stage of this.__processStages) {
      const methodName = stage.methodName;
      const commonMethodName = 'common_' + methodName;
      const componentTids = this.__componentRepository.getComponentTIDs();
      // Next, loop through the components in order of type
      for (let componentTid of componentTids) {
        // Loop through an array of expressions
        for (let exp of expressions) {
          let loopN = 1;
          if (componentTid === MeshRendererComponent.componentTID) {
            loopN = exp!.renderPasses.length;
          }
          // Looping over an array of render paths held by the expression
          for (let i = 0; i < loopN; i++) {
            const renderPass = exp!
            if (componentTid === MeshRendererComponent.componentTID && (stage == ProcessStage.Render)) {
              this.__webglResourceRepository.bindFramebuffer(renderPass.getFramebuffer());
              this.__webglResourceRepository.setViewport(renderPass.getViewport());
              this.__webglResourceRepository.setDrawTargets(renderPass.getFramebuffer());
              clearFrameBuffer(renderPass); this.__webglResourceRepository.clearFrameBuffer(renderPass);
            }

            const componentClass: typeof Component = ComponentRepository.getComponentClass(componentTid)! ;
            // Update the Entity list to be processed in the component's current processing stage and pipeline
            componentClass.updateComponentsOfEachProcessStage(componentClass, stage, this.__componentRepository, renderPass);

            const componentClass_commonMethod = (componentClass as any)[commonMethodName];

            // common to all Entities to be processed in the component's current processing stage.
            if (componentClass_commonMethod) {
              componentClass_commonMethod({ processApproach: this.__processApproach, renderPass: renderPass, processStage: stage, renderPassTickCount: this.__renderPassTickCount });
            }

            // Process components. Specifically, the Entity group to be processed in the current processing stage is processed by the instance method of the Component class corresponding to the current processing stage.
            componentClass.process({
              componentType: componentClass,
              processStage: stage,
              processApproach: this.__processApproach,
              componentRepository: this.__componentRepository,
              strategy: this.__webglStrategy!
              renderPass: renderPass,
              renderPassTickCount: this.__renderPassTickCount
            });

            this.__renderPassTickCount++;

            if (stage === ProcessStage.Render && renderPass.getResolveFramebuffer()) {
              renderPass.copyFramebufferToResolveFramebuffer();
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }

    Time._processEnd();
  }
````

In a simplified, bulleted format, the loop process goes around in the following flow.

- Loops are executed in order of "processing stage" type.
  - Loop process executed in order of component type
    - Looping through an array of expressions
      - Loop through the expression's array of render paths
        - Update the Entity list to be processed in the component's current processing stage and render pass
        - In the current processing stage of the component, perform processing common to all Entities to be processed
        - Process components
          - The group of Entities to be processed in the current processing stage is processed by the instance method of the Component class corresponding to the current processing stage.

Simply put, the "processing stages" such as Create, Load, and Render are the largest processing stages.
In each processing stage, further processing is performed on a component-by-component basis, and in the processing of that component, a large number of component instances are processed so that they flow at once, as many as the number of Entities that possess that component.
