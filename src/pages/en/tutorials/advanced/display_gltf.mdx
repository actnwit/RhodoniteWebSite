This section explains how to display glTF in Rhodonite.
Rhodonite supports glTF1 and glTF2 and VRM.

## How to import glTF

### Using GltfImporter
The easiest way is to use the GltfImporter class.
This class automatically determines glTF1, glTF2, and VRM and loads them appropriately.
The import method of this class returns an object of type IResult when called using await.
If the loading is successful, the get method can be used to retrieve the expression object.
This expression can be passed directly to the process method of the System class for drawing.

```typescript
const result = await Rn.GltfImporter.import(gltfUrl, loadOption);
if (result.isOk()) {
  const expression = result.get();
}
```

If checking for success is too much trouble, you can force the retrieval with the unwrapForce() method, but if the result of result is an error, an exception will be raised.

```typescript
const result = await Rn.GltfImporter.import(gltfUrl, loadOption);
const expression = result.unwrapForce();
```

## Use Gltf1Importer or Gltf2Importer

There are also version-specific Importers, such as the Gltf1Importer or Gltf2Importer. These return data in a proprietary format called [RnM2](https://github.com/actnwit/RhodoniteTS/blob/master/src/types/RnM2.ts) in result object rather than expression.
RnM2 is the glTF2 data in which the logical connection relationships between the indexes of the glTF items are resolved to references to the actual objects.
This is passed to ModelConverter to obtain the Entity of the root of the scene graph of the read glTF.

```typescript
    const result = await Rn.Gltf2Importer.import(
      '../../../assets/gltf/glTF-Sample-Models/2.0/BoxAnimated/glTF/BoxAnimated.gltf'
    );
    const rnm = result.unwrapForce();
    const rootGroup = Rn.ModelConverter.convertToRhodoniteObject(rnm);

    const expression = new Rn.Expression();
    const renderPass = new Rn.RenderPass();
    renderPass.addEntities([rootGroup]);
    expression.addRenderPasses([renderPass]);
```
