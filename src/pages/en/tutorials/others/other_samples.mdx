That's all for the tutorial, but if you want more reference code, take a peek in the [samples](https://github.com/actnwit/RhodoniteTS/tree/main/samples) directory of the Rhodonite project! The samples directory is a good place to start. There are a variety of sample source codes to help you with your coding.

After cloning the Rhodonite project, type the following command under the project to start the local server.

```
$ yarn start
yarn run v1.22.19
node server.js
Express server is running at http://localhost:8082
```

Go to `http://localhost:8082` to see the sample in action.
